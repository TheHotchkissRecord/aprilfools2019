		As the snow melts all around campus, many students are looking forward to getting back on the golf course after a long wait. Since 1924, students have only had access to the course two of the three seasons they spend on campus and are often slowed down by weather.  In response, visionary Head of School Mr. Craig Bradley and his fearless administration have decided to move the golf course indoors, so that people can enjoy it all year round
</p><p>
		The administration is hoping that this change will get more people on the golf course. Dr. Gibb ’85, Dean of Community Life, said, “We have decided to move the golf course indoors as to encourage more students to get out and enjoy the course. We know that it plays an integral part in Hotchkiss culture and hope that with these changes, it can have an even more positive impact. I know how much I enjoyed it during my days as a student.”
</p><p>
		Night golfing has also become increasingly more popular, and the administration hopes that moving the golf course inside will help more students get involved. Mr. Bradley said, “We know how much the students love using the golf course, so we wanted to make it available to them 24/7. We hope the students have a lot of fun, make many memories, and as always, stay safe.”
</p><p>
		The administration understands how the golf course is a great place for students to get closer with each other. Head Coach of Girls Varsity Golf, David Bolmer ’73 said, “Many people have come up to me and told me how much they love being on the golf course, so I know that moving it indoors would be a great decision by the administration. When I was a student here, I was always on the golf course with different people. It was a great way for me to make new friends.”
</p><p>
		The course will be relocated to Fowle Gym, a space that has proven difficult to fill in the past. This, in turn, will put Varsity boys and Girls basketball in the Field house, which will create a more “homey,” tight-knit environment. The school is excited to see how these positive new changes will help build not only better golf teams, but more long-lasting relationships.

        <p>The Concerned Golfers are a group formed from those who have been tested and tried by the harsh winter of only being able to look at the golf course from the practice rooms of the music wing. Upon hearing they might have the opportunity to use the golf course all winter long they wrote an article about it for <i>The Record</i>.</p>

        <h3>About <i>The Record:</i></h3>
        <p><i>The Record</i> is a biweekly student run newspaper. It is well known for its inability to catch mistakes and common occurences of "Fake News." At this point it is just the Fox News of the Hotchkiss bubble; unreliable yet entertaining, but still read by the respective president.</p><p>In 2018, <i>The Record</i> launched the digital platform to create the potential to reach members of the extended Hotchkiss community. Unfortunately, statistics have revealed that the greatest use of the website is each editor clicking the login button at the bottom of the page, thus defeating the purpose of the website. It now mostly houses a collection of the dankest memes available on the internet hand curated by the staff.</p><p>In the future, <i>The Record</i> plans to hire a full staff of meme content creators in order to establish its place as the premiere meme content creation company.</p>
